1. Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. Explain how they work and what the output was.

Sort returned the contents of command.js alphabetically sorted line by line.
Wc showed the number of lines, words and characters in the commands.js file.
Uniq returned only the unique lines in the code. Took out any lines that are duplicates.
    

2. Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js. Explain what the output was and why the specific data was outputted.

A:  sort command.js | uniq

    The output was commands.js without duplicates sorted alphabetically.
    The sort command sorted the document line by line and the sorted document was used with the uniq command which then eliminated the duplicates. 


6. In this checkpoint, you encountered built-in JavaScript methods as well as the new ES6 syntax. Review the information below before attempting the programming challenge.

A: function reverseString(str) {
  	 console.log(str.split(" ").map((word)=>word.split('').reverse().join("")).join(" "));
	}
	

	reverseString("Hello World");
